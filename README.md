This is an expo-managed React Native mobile app that lets a user create and save recipes. Nutrition information for ingredients can be inputted manually, or populated automatically by scanning a barcode, which then is the input to an FDC API query.

Note: This app was only tested on an expo-managed workflow (ie through the Expo Go app) on an Android phone
